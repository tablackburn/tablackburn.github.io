[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m excited to announce the release of AIM (AI Agent Instruction Modules) v0.7.0! This project is now available on GitHub and provides a standardized approach to managing AI agent instructions across codebases.\nThe Problem Working with AI coding agents like GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, and others is powerful, but each project often needs custom instructions to work effectively. Managing these instructions can be inconsistent—they might be scattered across .claude, .cursorrules, CLAUDE.md, COPILOT.md, or various other locations.\nConsider a typical scenario: Your team has 10 repositories. In repository A, you\u0026rsquo;ve created a .claude file with your coding standards. In repository B, someone used .cursorrules for Cursor. Repository C has a plain text COPILOT.md file. Repository D has nothing. When you update a best practice, you need to manually update all of them. This fragmentation makes it hard to:\nMaintain consistent practices across projects Share best practices between teams Keep instructions up-to-date across multiple repositories Ensure all team members use the same agent guidance The Solution AIM is a modular, opt-in collection of instruction modules that work with all major AI coding agents through the standardized agents.md format. The agents.md standard is an open specification for AI agent instructions, supported by GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and other popular coding agents. By leveraging this standard, AIM ensures your instructions work reliably across all these platforms without vendor lock-in. It provides:\nCore Features 12+ Instruction Modules: Covering workflows, standards, and best practices Language \u0026amp; Tool Specific Modules: PowerShell, Markdown, GitHub CLI, and more Repository Management: Release procedures, version control, and contribution guidelines Easy Deployment: Simple setup with templates and deployment procedures Customizable: Extend with repository-specific instructions while staying synchronized What AIM Includes Core Modules Agent Workflow - Pre-flight protocol for AI agents to follow Shorthand - Guidelines for avoiding abbreviations in code Git Workflow - Branching, commits, and pull request conventions Testing - Test writing best practices and conventions Language \u0026amp; Tool Modules PowerShell - Cmdlet naming, parameter conventions, and scripting best practices Markdown - Documentation formatting and structure guidelines README - README maintenance guidelines GitHub CLI - Efficient PR and issue management workflows Repository Management Releases - Release management with semantic versioning Update - Procedures for keeping downstream repositories current Contributing - Workflow for contributing improvements upstream Quick Start Head over to the AIM GitHub repository for complete setup instructions. The README includes:\nAutomated Deployment - Copy a prompt into your AI agent for fully automated setup Manual Alternative - Step-by-step instructions if you prefer to set things up manually Updating Instructions - How to keep your instructions synchronized with the latest releases Repository Structure - Complete overview of all included modules The documentation is kept up-to-date with each release, ensuring you always have the latest deployment procedures and prompts.\nWho Should Use AIM? AIM is ideal for:\nTeams managing multiple repositories - Standardize practices across your entire codebase Organizations standardizing on AI agents - Ensure consistent behavior regardless of which agent team members use Open source projects - Provide clear guidance to contributors working with AI coding assistants DevOps and platform teams - Enforce standards and best practices across all downstream projects Solo developers - Maintain consistent standards as your projects grow Enterprises - Build a foundation for AI agent governance and compliance Whether you\u0026rsquo;re starting fresh or migrating from scattered instruction files, AIM provides a proven, tested approach that grows with your needs.\nRepository Structure The project is organized as:\nRoot files: AGENTS.md, CHANGELOG.md, README.md, and contribution guidelines instructions/ folder: 12+ modular instruction files covering workflows, languages, and tooling tests/ folder: Pester tests that validate instruction integrity CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflows for continuous validation For a complete folder listing, see the project repository.\nCommunity Contributions AIM is open to community contributions! We\u0026rsquo;re looking for new instruction modules for:\nLanguages: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, C#, and others Frameworks: React, FastAPI, ASP.NET, Django, and more Tool Integrations: Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, and additional tools Each module should include YAML frontmatter with applyTo patterns and follow the conventions established in existing modules. See CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed guidelines.\nWhy This Matters As AI coding agents become more powerful and widely adopted, having consistent, well-documented instructions across your projects becomes critical. AIM eliminates the guesswork and provides a proven, tested foundation that you can build upon.\nWhether you\u0026rsquo;re working alone or with a large team, across one project or dozens, AIM helps ensure your AI agents work effectively within your standards and practices.\nGet Started Today Visit the AIM Repository to get started. The project includes complete documentation, examples, and automated setup procedures.\nHappy coding!\nP.S. — This blog post was written with the help of AI. As a result, it follows best practices, passes all linting rules, and was completed in a fraction of the time it would have taken manually. Ironic? Perhaps. Fitting? Absolutely.\n","date":"2025-12-28T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://tablackburn.github.io/p/announcing-ai-agent-instruction-modules/","title":"Announcing AIM: AI Agent Instruction Modules"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m excited to announce the release of my first PowerShell module: ScheduledTasksManager v0.1.0! This module is now available on the PowerShell Gallery and addresses a real challenge I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered in enterprise environments.\nThe Problem Managing scheduled tasks in Windows Server Failover Clusters can be complex and error-prone. The built-in ScheduledTasks module from Microsoft works great for standalone systems, but when you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with clustered environments, you need additional functionality to handle tasks across multiple nodes effectively.\nThe Solution ScheduledTasksManager extends the capabilities of Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s built-in module with cluster-aware functionality. It provides comprehensive functions for managing scheduled tasks in both standalone and clustered Windows environments.\nKey Features Cluster-Aware Operations: Register, enable, disable, start, and monitor scheduled tasks across failover cluster nodes Advanced Monitoring: Retrieve detailed task information, run history, and cluster node details Configuration Management: Export and import task configurations for backup and deployment scenarios Smart Filtering: Filter tasks by state, type, and ownership across cluster nodes Secure Authentication: Built-in support for credential management and CIM sessions Quick Start Getting started is simple:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 # Install from PowerShell Gallery Install-Module -Name ScheduledTasksManager -Repository PSGallery # Import the module Import-Module ScheduledTasksManager # Get all clustered scheduled tasks Get-StmClusteredScheduledTask -Cluster \u0026#34;MyCluster\u0026#34; # Register a new clustered task Register-StmClusteredScheduledTask -Cluster \u0026#34;MyCluster\u0026#34; ` -TaskName \u0026#34;BackupTask\u0026#34; ` -TaskType \u0026#34;ClusterWide\u0026#34; What\u0026rsquo;s Included The module includes 11 comprehensive functions:\nTask retrieval and information gathering Task registration and removal Task state management (enable/disable) Manual task execution and monitoring Configuration export capabilities Each function includes detailed help documentation and practical examples.\nEnterprise Ready ScheduledTasksManager is designed for enterprise environments with features like:\nCredential delegation support Comprehensive error handling Standardized PowerShell function patterns Built-in validation for cluster operations Looking Forward This initial release (v0.1.0) establishes the foundation for cluster-aware scheduled task management.
