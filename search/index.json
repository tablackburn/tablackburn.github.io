[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m excited to announce the release of my first PowerShell module: ScheduledTasksManager v0.1.0! This module is now available on the PowerShell Gallery and addresses a real challenge I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered in enterprise environments.\nThe Problem Managing scheduled tasks in Windows Server Failover Clusters can be complex and error-prone. The built-in ScheduledTasks module from Microsoft works great for standalone systems, but when you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with clustered environments, you need additional functionality to handle tasks across multiple nodes effectively.\nThe Solution ScheduledTasksManager extends the capabilities of Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s built-in module with cluster-aware functionality. It provides comprehensive functions for managing scheduled tasks in both standalone and clustered Windows environments.\nKey Features Cluster-Aware Operations: Register, enable, disable, start, and monitor scheduled tasks across failover cluster nodes Advanced Monitoring: Retrieve detailed task information, run history, and cluster node details Configuration Management: Export and import task configurations for backup and deployment scenarios Smart Filtering: Filter tasks by state, type, and ownership across cluster nodes Secure Authentication: Built-in support for credential management and CIM sessions Quick Start Getting started is simple:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 # Install from PowerShell Gallery Install-Module -Name ScheduledTasksManager -Repository PSGallery # Import the module Import-Module ScheduledTasksManager # Get all clustered scheduled tasks Get-StmClusteredScheduledTask -Cluster \u0026#34;MyCluster\u0026#34; # Register a new clustered task Register-StmClusteredScheduledTask -Cluster \u0026#34;MyCluster\u0026#34; -TaskName \u0026#34;BackupTask\u0026#34; -TaskType \u0026#34;ClusterWide\u0026#34; What\u0026rsquo;s Included The module includes 11 comprehensive functions:\nTask retrieval and information gathering Task registration and removal Task state management (enable/disable) Manual task execution and monitoring Configuration export capabilities Each function includes detailed help documentation and practical examples.\nEnterprise Ready ScheduledTasksManager is designed for enterprise environments with features like:\nCredential delegation support Comprehensive error handling Standardized PowerShell function patterns Built-in validation for cluster operations Looking Forward This initial release (v0.1.0) establishes the foundation for cluster-aware scheduled task management.
